				<h2>1. Ontology Description</h2>
				<p align="justify">The Software Process Ontology (SPO) aims at establishing a common conceptualization on the Software Process domain, including processes, activities, resources, people, artifacts and procedures. As a core ontology, SPO provides the general concepts for software processes, to be specialized and reused in domain-specific ontologies.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 1. SPO Modularization .</b></p>
<p align="justify">Process-related packages address the three SPO process levels, describing processes and activities, how they are composed and related to their assets: (i) Standard Processes, described in the Standard Software Process Definition package; (ii) Intended Processes, represented in the Intended Software Process Definition and Scheduling package; and (iii) Performed Processes, depicted in the Software Process Execution package. All the process levels use process assets that are classified in four types: Agents, Artifacts, Resources, and Procedures.</p>
<p>Figure 2 presents the SPO Color Pattern.</p>
<p align="center"><IMG src="images/SPO Color Pattern.png"></p>
<p align="center"><b>Figure 2. SPO Color Pattern.</b></p>
<p align="justify">In order to facilitate concepts identification, SPO adopts a color pattern for differentiating the main notions in the ontology: concepts in Yellow are related to processes and activities, concepts in Green refer to artifacts, concepts in Blue concern agents, concepts in Purple are related to resources as hardware and software, concepts in Pink refer to procedures. Concepts in Gray are external, from other SEON ontologies. Darker colors represent types. White is used for domain concepts in domain ontologies.</p>

<h3><a name="SPO_Intended+Software+Process+Definition_section">3.1.  Intended Software Process Definition</a></h3>
<p align="justify">Intended Processes relate to processes intended to be performed in the context of a specific project or organizational area. Intended processes can be Scheduled to be executed in a specified period of time.

<p align="center"><b>Figure 4. Intended Activity Definition conceptual model.</b></p>
<p align="justify">An Intended Activity needs to define its relations with the process assets. As an adaptation of a Standard Activity considering the peculiarities of its context, it can reuse and adapt the assets established at the standard level. Thus, an Intended Activity can define the Organizational Role responsible for performing it (e.g. a Requirements activity that is to be performed by a person with the role Requirements Engineer); the types of Artifacts to be created, changed or used (e.g. a Project Planning activity that creates an artifact of the type Project Plan); the types of required resources (e.g. a Testing activity requiring a software of the type Testing Tool); and the adopted Procedures (e.g. a Conceptual Modeling activity adopting a OO Method).</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 5. Intended Process Structure conceptual model.</b></p>
<p align="justify">An Intended Process refers to the commitments made for defining a process intended to be performed in a specific project or organizational area, considering its peculiarities. It is often defined by adapting a Standard Process, considering a specific context. For Projects, it is a Project Process defining how to conduct the activities within the Project (e.g. the Development Process defined for the Alpha Project). It also can be defined in an organizational context, regardless of specific projects, being an Organizational Intended Process (e.g. the Human Resource Management Process defined for hiring new Employees). Intended Processes can be general or specific. A General Intended Process is composed of at least two Specific Intended Processes (e.g. a Training Process composed of Planning, Preparation, Execution and Evaluation Processes). A Specific Intended Process is composed of at least two Intended Activities.<br/>An Intended Activity refers to the commitments made within a broader Intended Process. Analogously, it uses to be adapted from a Standard Activity, and can be composite or simple. A Composite Standard Activity is composed of other two or more Intended Activities; a Simple Intended Activity is not decomposable into smaller activities. Moreover, Intended Activities can depend on other Intended Activities.</p>

<p align="justify">Scheduled Processes and Activities are specializations of Intended Processes and Activities (respectively), defined as appointments scheduled for a specific period of time. For example, the intended Testing Process of the Alpha Project can be scheduled for September 1st to 20th. Since Scheduled Process and Activity specialize Intended Process and Activity, they inherit all the relations (such as compositions, assets and adaptations) and remain information.</p>

<p align="justify">Procedures are normative descriptions prescribing a defined way for performing the activities that adopt it. They can be of three types: Method, Technique and Document Template. A Method is a systematic procedure defining a workflow of activities (a set of steps) and heuristics to perform one or more activities. As a Method can be applied for different activities, it can have one or more Method Workflows (e.g. an OO Method can provide distinct workflows for the analysis and design activities), denoting a combination of Method Activities for the execution of process activities. Technique is a procedure that provides heuristics to perform an activity (but in a less rigid and detailed way than a Method, since it does not prescribe a set of activities). Examples of Techniques are pair programming, white-box testing, and brainstorming. Finally, a Document Template is a procedure establishing a uniform way for preparing a Document, providing a predefined format and a defined structure for filling it with the required information (e.g. a Project Plan Template, a Test Report Template).</p>

<p align="justify">Performed Processes and Activities are actions performed in a specific period of time, in the past. They typically are the processes or activities executed in a project or organization by some agent. A Performed Process can occur in a Project, configuring a Project Performed Process (such as a performed Design Process), or in the context of an Organization, configuring an Organizational Performed Process (such as a performed Recruitment Process).<br/>A Performed Process can be general or specific. A General Performed Process is composed of two or more Specific Performed Processes (e.g. a Development Process can be composed of Requirements, Design, Construction and Test Processes). Specific Performed Processes are composed of two or more Performed Activities. A Performed Activity, analogously, can be simple or composite. A Composite Performed Activity is composed of other Performed Activities; a Simple Performed Activity is an atomic action that cannot be decomposed into smaller activities. Performed Activities can also depend on other Performed Activities (e.g. a Review activity that depends on a Documentation activity).</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 15. Standard Activity Definition conceptual model.</b></p>
<p align="justify">A Standard Activity, institutionalized as a generic action, establishes a number of relations with the process assets or their types. These relations are important for guiding the definition of processes and activities in the other two process levels (Intended and Performed).<br/>Standard Activities can depend on other Standard Activities, setting a preferred execution order. A Standard Activity can define the types of Artifacts to be created, changed or used (e.g. a Requirements Documentation activity that creates an artifact of the type Requirements Document). A Standard Activity can establish the types of its required resources (e.g. a Conceptual Modeling activity requiring a software product of the type UML Modeling Tool). Standard Activities can also set up their adopted Procedures (e.g. a Coding activity adopting a Programming Technique). Finally, the Standard Activities can define the Organizational Roles that should perform them (e.g. a Design activity that is to be performed by a person playing the Designer role).</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 16. Standard Process Structure conceptual model.</b></p>
<p align="justify">Standard Processes and Activities are institutionalized generic actions establishing basic requirements for intended processes and activities to be performed in an organization or in its projects (for example, a standard Development Process, and its activities, to be performed in the Projects of an Organization). A Standard Process Definition Document, used for describing a set of Standard Processes, is recognized by one or more Organizations.<br/>A Standard Process is established to be performed in the context of projects, configuring a Project Standard Process (such as a standard Development Process), in the context of an organization, configuring an Organizational Standard Process (such as a standard Portfolio Management Process), or can be applicable to both contexts, configuring a Hybrid Standard Process (such as a standard Training Process).<br/>A Standard Process can be general or specific. A General Standard Process is composed of two or more Specific Standard Processes (e.g. a standard Development Process composed of standard Requirements, Design, Constructions and Test Processes). A Specific Standard Process is composed of two or more Standard Activities. A Standard Activity, analogously, can be composite or simple. A Composite Standard Activity is composed of other two or more Standard Activities; a Simple Standard Activity is not decomposable into smaller activities.<br/>Every process and activity performed in an organization or project happen based on an action type. For processes, this action type is the Process Universal, and for activities, this type is the Activity Universal. These generic actions can be formalized in an organization (configuring the discussed Standard Process and Activities), or remain non-formalized.</p>
