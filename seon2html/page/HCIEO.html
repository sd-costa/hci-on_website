Evaluation: systematic determination of the extent to which an entity meets its specified criteria

ISO 9241-220: 2019
Inspection-based evaluation: evaluation based on the judgment of one or more evaluator(s) who examine or use a system to identify potential usability problemas and/or deviations from established criteria

Note: inspection-based evaluation is a generic ter for methods that include, but are not limited to, heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthroughs, standards inspection, pluralistic walkthroughs, and consistency inspections

ISO 25066:2019
Inspection-based evaluation: evaluation based on the judgment of one or more evaluator(s) who examine or use a system to identify potential usability problems (including deviations from established criteria).

Note: The evaluators making the inspections typically are usability specialists but can also include end users and members of the design team.

ISO 9241-220: 2019
User-based evaluation: evaluation that involves representative users performing tasks with the system to enable identification of human-centred quality problems and/or measurements of efficiency, effectiveness, user satisfaction or other user experiences

ISO 25066:2019
User-based evaluation: evaluation that involves representative users performing tasks with the system to enable identification of usability problems and/or measurements of efficiency, effectiveness, user satisfaction or other user experiences

ISO 25066:2019
Usability problem: situation during use resulting in poor effectiveness, efficiency or satisfaction

ISO 25066:2019
Usability defect: product attribute(s) that lead(s) to a mismatch between user intentions and/or user actions and the system attributes and behavior

Note 1: typical usability defects include the following: additional unnecessary steps not required as part of completing a task; misleading information; insufficient and/or poor information on the user interface; unexpected system responses; limitations in navigation; inefficient use error recovery mechanism; physical characteristics of the user interface that are not suitable for the physical characteristics of the user.

Note 2: Deviations of product attributes of the object of evaluation from established criteria are also usability defects.

ISO 9241-220: 2019
Human-centred quality: extent to which requirements for usability, accessibility, user experience and avoidance of harm from user are met.

Note 1: Human-centred quality is a collective term for the intended outcomes of interaction of the user with the system

ISO 25060: 2010
Usability objective: stated level of usability expressed in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use which can be verified

Note: usability objectives can be stated as user requirements, in which case the level to be achieved is a usability requirement, or they can be stated as desired "target levels" depending on their use in design and evaluation

ISO 25060: 2010
Usability inspection: evaluation based on the considered judgment of evaluators who examine the usability-related aspects of an interface with respect to specified criteria

Note: usability inspection is the generic term for several methods, including but not limited to heuristic evaluation, cognitive walkthroughs, standards inspection, pluralistic walkthroughs, and consistency inspections.

ISO 25060: 2010
usability testing: evaluation that involves representative users performing specific tasks with the system to enable the measurement of efficiency, effectiveness, and/or user satisfaction

ISO 25060: 2010
usability-walkthrough: usability evaluation in which one or more evaluators step through a scenario playing the role of a user and identifying usability problems associated with successful completion of the scenario.

ISO/IEC 14598-5:1998
Evaluation method: a procedure describing the action to be performed by the evaluator in order to obtain the result for the specified measurement or verification applied on the specified product components or on the product as a whole

ISO/TR 16982: 2002
usability method: method supporting human-centred design used for the purpose of increasing the usability of a product or a system

ISO/TS 18152:2010
Formative evaluation: evaluation designed and used to improve the object of evaluation, especially when it is still being developed

ISO/TS 18152:2010
Summative evaluation: evaluation designed to present conclusions about the merit or worth of the object of evaluation and recommendations about whether it should be retained, altered or eliminated

<p align="justify">HCI Evaluation is a Complex Action and, like that, it is an intentional event. It is caused by the HCI Evaluator Intention that inheres in the HCI Evaluator. Being an Intention, HCI Evaluaton Intention has a HCI Evaluator Goal (Goal) as propositional content. HCI Evaluator is the role played by an individual or an organization (Stakeholder) that performs the HCI Evaluation.<br/><br/>An HCI Evaluation consists in the systematic determination of the extent to which an Interactive Computer System ’s (or its User Interface ) quality characteristics (HCI Quality Characteristic) meet the HCI Evaluation Criteria applied in the evaluation. HCI Evaluation Criteria, in turn, are conditions, or capacity needed (Requirement), used to evaluate Interactive Computer System ’s HCI Quality Characteristics and may be related to User Requirements.<br/><br/>HCI Quality Characteritics are qualities (Quality Universal) of an Interactive Computer System (manifested in its software or hardware constituents). Therefore, HCI Evaluation evaluates HCI Quality Characteristics of an Interactive Computer System or, more specifically, of its User Interface.<br/><br/>An HCI Evaluation follows HCI Evaluation Method (e.g., Heuristic Method, Usability Testing), which is a Procedure that describes the actions to be performed by the HCI Evaluator in an HCI Evaluation. An HCI Evaluation Method is chosen according to the HCI Evaluator Goal and can determine the HCI Evaluation Criteria to be applied in an HCI Evaluation. To perform an HCI Evaluation it may be necessary to use an HCI Evaluation Artifact (Sw Artifact), which is an object intentionally built to specify, among others, the HCI Evaluation Criteria to be applied in the evaluation (e.g., a checklist specifying the criteria to be applied).<br/><br/>In some HCI Evaluations it is necessary to evaluate the Interactive Computer System during the Human-Computer Interaction . In this case, the User (or user representatives) of the Interactive Computer System participates in the HCI Evaluation while, at the same time, participates (User Participation ), together with the Interactive Computer System (Interactive Computer System Participation ), in the Human-Computer Interaction . When the User participates in an HCI Evaluation, it is required that this User uses the Interactive Computer System in order to achieve a certain goal (User Goal ) (e.g., send an email). While the User interacts with the Interactive Computer System to achieve his/her goal (User Goal ), the HCI Evaluator performs the HCI Evaluation, following the HCI Evaluation Method and applying HCI Evaluation Criteria to evaluate HCI Quality Characteristics of the Interactive Computer System . This scenario involves some constraints, addressed by the following axioms:<br/><br/>A6.1. &forall; hcie: HCI Evaluation, ics: Interactive Computer System, icsp: Interactive Computer System Participation, hci: Human-Computer Interaction, user: User evaluates(hcie, ics) &and; participatesIn(user, hcie) &and; composedOf(hci, icsp) &rarr; &exist; up: User Participation participationOf(user, up) &and; composedOf(hci, up)<br/><br/>A6.2. &forall; hcie: HCI Evaluation, hci: Human-Computer Interaction, hciqc: HCI Quality Characteristic, ics: Interactive Computer System, icsp: Interactive Computer System Participation evaluates(hcie, hci) ∧ evaluates(hcie,hciqc) &and; has(ics, hciqc) &and; composedOf(hci, icsp) &and; participationOf(icsp, ics) &rarr; evaluates(hcie, ics)<br/><br/>Moreover, in an HCI Evaluation an HCI Evaluator can act as a User . Conversely, a User can act as an HCI Evaluator. Thus, if an evaluator performs an evaluation in which he/she acts as a user, then this evaluator is also the user who participates in the evaluation. On the other hand, if a user that participates in an evaluation performs that evaluation, then he/she is also an evaluator of that evaluation. Hence, the following axiom applies:<br/><br/>A6.3. &forall; e: HCI Evaluator, hcie: HCI Evaluation performs(e, hcie) &and; participatesIn(e, hcie) &rarr; &exist; u: User participatesIn(u, hcie) &and; (e = u)<br/><br/>A6.4. &forall; u: User, hcie: HCI Evaluation participatesIn(u, hcie) &and; performs(u, hcie) &rarr; &exist; e: HCI Evaluator performs(e, hcie) &and; (e = u)<br/><br/>After the HCI Evaluation is performed, the HCI Evaluation Report, a Document, is created, under responsibility of the HCI Evaluator, aiming to report the evaluation results and other relevant information, such as the applied HCI Evaluation Criteria.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Figure 3. HCIEO Complementary View conceptual model.</b></p>
<p align="justify">There are HCI Evaluations in which it is necessary to perform measurements to determine the extent to which HCI Quality characteristics of an Interactive Computer System meet HCI Evaluation Criteria. This is addressed in the conceptual model shown in Figure 6.5, which depicts a view of HCIEO that reuses concepts from COM to represent evaluations that quantify HCI Quality Characteristics.<br/><br/>Besides being Objects (grounding in UFO), Interactive Computer System and User Interface are also Measurable Entities, i.e., entities that can be measured. In this sense, HCI Quality Characteristic is subtype of Measurable Element, i.e., a measurable property that characterizes Interactive Computer System (or a User Interface ). Measures can be used to quantify HCI Quality Characteristics. For example, usability (HCI Quality Characteristic) characterizesasystem(Interactive Computer System)oritsUI(User Interface)and can be quantified, among others, by means of the number of wrong clicks or touches (Measure). HCI Evaluation Criteria can refer to Measures used to quantify HCI Quality Characteristic. For example, the criteria “the number of wrong clicks or touches must be smaller than two”, used to evaluate usability, refers to the measure number of wrong clicks or touches, which, in turn, is used to quantify usability. In this context, the Measure referred by an HCI Evaluation Criteria in an HCI Evaluation that evaluates a HCI Quality Characteristic must be a Measure used to quantify that HCI Quality Characteristic. Thus:<br/><br/>A6.5. &forall; m: Measure, hciec: HCI Evaluation criteria, hcie: HCI Evaluation, hciqc: HCI Quality Characteristic evaluates(hcie, hciqc) &and; applies(hcie, hciec) &and; usedToEvaluate(hciec, hciqc) &and; refersTo(hciec, m) &rarr; quantifies(m, hciqc)<br/><br/>A Measure (e.g., time spent to log in the system) can be expressed in Measure Unit (e.g., minute) and has a Scale partitioned according to the Measure Unit and composed of the values that can be associated to the Measure. Measurement consists in collecting Measured Values to a Measure (e.g., the measurement of the time to log in the system, resulting in the value 1 minute). In an HCI Evaluation, Measurements are performed to establish Measured Values to quantify HCI Quality Characteristics.<br/><br/>When a HCI Evaluation involves measurements, the HCI Evaluation Report must consider the Measured Values.</p>
