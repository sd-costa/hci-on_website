abstract = {Developing interactive systems is a challenging task. It involves concerns related to the human-computer interaction (HCI), such as usability and user experience. Therefore, HCI design must be addressed when developing such systems. HCI design often involves people with different backgrounds, technical languages, terms and knowledge, what makes communication and knowledge transfer a challenging issue. In this scenario, knowledge management can support understanding concepts from different knowledge areas and help learn from previous experiences. Knowledge management has supported HCI design mainly to improve product quality and reduce effort and time spent on design activities. However, there is a need for simpler and more practical knowledge management solutions to support HCI design. In addition, the lack of a common conceptualization about HCI design has been one of the main challenges to be addressed. This leads to semantic interoperability problems, such as ambiguity and imprecision when interpreting shared information, and hampers communication and knowledge transfer. Aiming to provide a well-founded conceptualization about HCI design domain in the context of the development of interactive systems, this work proposes HCIDO (Human-Computer Interaction Design Ontology). HCIDO is a reference ontology of the Human-Computer Interaction Ontology Network (HCI-ON) and is also connected to the Software Engineering Ontology Network (SEON), allowing for the reuse of concepts related to Software Engineering and HCI aspects, such as requirements, code, interactive systems and users, as well as making them connected to design aspects. HCIDO was evaluated through verification and validation techniques. Moreover, a computational tool was developed using HCIDO as a reference model, illustrating how the ontology can be applied to support knowledge management solutions in HCI design. The tool supports knowledge management activities (e.g., knowledge capture, representation, storage, retrieval, use and evaluation) in the HCI design of interactive systems by allowing HCI designers to annotate structured information about design choices in design artifacts shared with HCI design stakeholders.},

abstract = {Developing interactive systems is a challenging task that involves concerns related to the human-computer interaction (HCI), such as usability and user experience. Therefore, HCI design is a core issue when developing such systems. It often involves people with different backgrounds (e.g., Arts, Software Engineering, Design), which makes knowledge transfer a challenging issue. Ontologies have been acknowledged as a successful approach to represent domain knowledge and support knowledge-based solutions. Hence, in this work, we propose to explore ontologies to represent structured knowledge and improve knowledge sharing in HCI design. We briefly present the Human-Computer Interaction Design Ontology (HCIDO), a reference ontology that addresses HCI design aspects that connect HCI and Software Engineering concerns. By making knowledge related to the HCI design domain explicit and structured, HCIDO has helped us to develop KTID, a tool that aims to support capturing and sharing useful knowledge to aid in HCI design. Preliminary results indicate that the tool may be particularly useful for novice HCI designers.},

@article{costa2021-SLR,
abstract = {Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) is a multidisciplinary area that involves a diverse body of knowledge and a complex landscape of concepts, which can lead to semantic problems, hampering communication and knowledge transfer. Ontologies have been successfully used to solve semantics and knowledge-related problems in several domains. This paper presents a systematic literature review that investigated the use of ontologies in the HCI domain. The main goal was to find out how HCI ontologies have been used and developed. 35 ontologies were identified. As a result, we noticed that they cover different HCI aspects, such as user interface, interaction phenomenon, pervasive computing, user modeling / profile, HCI design, interaction experience and adaptive interactive system. Although there are overlaps, we did not identify reuse among the 35 analyzed ontologies. The ontologies have been used mainly to support knowledge representation and reasoning. Although ontologies have been used in HCI for more than 25 years, their use became more frequent in the last decade, when ontologies address a higher number of HCI aspects and are represented as both conceptual and computational models. Concerning how ontologies have been developed, we noticed that some good practices of ontology engineering have not been followed. Considering that the quality of an ontology directly influences the quality of the solution built based on it, we believe that there is an opportunity for HCI and ontology engineering professionals to get closer to build better and more effective ontologies, as well as ontology-based solutions.},

abstract = {Engineering interactive computer systems is a challenging task that involves concerns related to the human-computer interaction (HCI), such as usability and user experience. HCI is a wide domain, where ontologies are useful instruments for supporting knowledge-related problems. However, HCI ontologies have been built and used in isolation. Ideally, in wide domains, ontologies should not be stand-alone artifacts. They should relate to each other, forming a network of interlinked semantic resources, i.e. an ontology network. Therefore, in this paper we introduce HCI-ON, a Human-Computer Interaction Ontology Network composed of ontologies that we have developed and others found in the literature. HCI-ON organizes and integrates knowledge, serving as a basis to several applications. We also discuss mechanisms to evolve HCI-ON and present some envisioned applications.},
